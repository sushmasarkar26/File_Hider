# File_Hider

Developed a File Hider project in Java with features such as encryption, OTP generation, email authentication, and MySQL integration.
Allocated around 40% of my efforts to implementing encryption algorithms, ensuring that files are securely hidden and protected.
Another 30% of my time was dedicated to developing the OTP generation and email authentication system, which enhances security by verifying user identities before granting access to hidden files.
The remaining 30% of the project involved integrating MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring that all user information and file data are managed seamlessly.
This project not only strengthened my Java skills but also deepened my understanding of security protocols and database management.
